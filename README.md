## History Disabler for Chromium
#####Version 1.4 | March 4 2016

Uses different methods to effectively disable history in Chrome (and other Chromium) browsers.

To lower memory usage, the extension does not persistently run in memory.

The only required permissions are `browsingData`, `history`, and `tabs`. [See here](https://github.com/rentamob/History-Disabler-for-Chromium/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#permissions) for an explanation of these permissions.
